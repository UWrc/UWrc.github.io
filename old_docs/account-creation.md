To log into any HYAK cluster you need an account created. Everyone falls into one of the following buckets. Follow through then once your sponsor has confirmed they've added you to their group, continue on to the next section to complete the final account activation.

## I have a PI and the PI contributed HYAK nodes.

Your PI can create a HYAK account for you by virtue of adding you to their group. Refer to the previous section about [adding users to a group](/docs/join-group).

## I have a PI and we have no HYAK nodes.

You need to <a href="mailto:help@uw.edu?subject=hyak free tier account">email us</a> to get a free tier account. Please provide your UW netID.

If your PI has purchased HYAK storage you will need them to follow the step above to be added to the group and have access to your shared data on the cluster after you're able to log in.

## I'm a UW student and I have no PI.

If you are a UW student tech fee (STF) paying student, which is almost every UW student, you are eligible to join the Research Computing Club (RCC). The RCC has a pool of nodes on every HYAK cluster for you to use. You can join the RCC and thereby get a Hyak account created through them [here](https://depts.washington.edu/uwrcc/getting-started-2/getting-started/) and use their resource capacity on the cluster. Once your account is created you can resume to the next page with instructions on how to activate.

## I am an external collaborator or I have no UW netID.

Having a UW netID is a pre-requisite for any type of HYAK account creation. If you are an external collaborator of a current HYAK user and need a UW netID you will need to have your UW collaborator sponsor you for a netID.

Please have them follow [these](https://itconnect.uw.edu/security/uw-netids/about-uw-netids/about-sponsored-uw-netids/) instructions then once you have your netID, find yourself in one of the previous categories to be added to a group. Once you are added to a group you can resume with account activation on the next page.
