        a basic definition of the cluster
        login node -> the rest of the cluster GRAPHIC!
    first 3 steps:
        join the mailing list
        enable 2fa (link)

Accessing Klone
    SSH or OOD
        LOGIN EULA
        login shell or ssh
    SSH Keys
        key locations / link to storage
        internal / intracluster keys
        external keys / hopping to nodes
            can't get you to the login node

    installing stuff
        1. you do it!
        2. it's linux, you do it where you can!

        jupyter, conda, conda in containers
    compilers
        we have some, you can install whatever you want
        amd vs intel

SSH
    port forwarding
        forwarding a single port through the login node
        picking a random port with bash
    x11 forwarding
        basic x explanation
        hi OOD exists
        x recommmendations
            basic setup
        x forwarding to login (y vs x flags)
            x forwarding to a node
        x forwarding directly to node with jump host
    advanced
        multiplexing
        ssh configs - wildcard for nodes

OnDemand
    Files
        explain the auto mounts
    Interactive Apps
        interactive job w/ shell
        interactive job w/ desktop
            terminal is on the node! can load modules etc
            this is a container, you can make your own
        jupyter
            this is a container, you can make your own
        r studio
            this is a container, you can make your own
