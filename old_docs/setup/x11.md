title: X11 Forwarding
---

Windows
-------
1. Install an X Server on your Windows machine, we recommend [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/).
2. If using PuTTY, select 'Enable X11 forwarding' in Connection > SSH > X11. No further options should need to be modified. If using ConEmu, add -X to your ssh connection string while connecting to Klone.
3. If it is working correctly, no error regarding XAuth should be received, and running the `xeyes` command on the Klone login node should spawn the eyes on your desktop.

Mac
---
1. Install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) as an X Server on your Mac either through a browser or `brew install xquartz`.
2. Add the following to your SSH Config in `~/.ssh/config` on your Mac:
   ```
   Host *
	 XAuthLocation /opt/X11/bin/xauth
   ```
3. Start XQuartz via the apps page or verify it running on the apps bar, feel free to close the terminal that pops up.
4. Connect to klone.hyak.uw.edu ,including the -X flag in your connection string.

Linux
-----
1. Connect to klone.hyak.uw.edu with the -X flag included in the connection string. Make sure to test with `xeyes` to ensure functionality.
2. Sit back, relax, and enjoy using the world's greatest kernel.
