In a large, distributed environment such as an HPC cluster, a scheduler is required to request compute resources and dispatch user processes (called "jobs") on them. There are several available for HPC systems but the most common one is called **Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management** or "SLURM" for short [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager)]. The HYAK clusters use SLURM so any general documentation you can find on the internet is valid, including directly from the developer [[SchedMD](https://slurm.schedmd.com)]. While SchedMD documentation is the most authoritative, this section has some common examples you might find useful with sample arguments specific to the KLONE cluster of HYAK.
