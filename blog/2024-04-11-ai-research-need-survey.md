Hello Hyak Community, 

The Research Working Group of the [UW AI Task Force](https://www.washington.edu/provost/2024/02/15/task-force-appointed-to-address-ai/) would like faculty and research staff input on the needs and challenges of using AI in research at UW across a broad spectrum of disciplines. Please help by responding to a short survey at: https://forms.gle/mZrV3aCgJYNNBV6j8. Responses by **April 25** would be most helpful, but the survey will remain open until **April 30**.

Thank you in advance for your time, 

Hyak Team
