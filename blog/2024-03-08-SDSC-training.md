Hello HYAK Community! 

We wanted to make you aware of two training opportunities with the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC). If you are interested in picking up some additional skills and experience in HPC, please check them out.

* **SDSC Cyberinfrastructure-Enabled Machine Learning (CIML) Summer Institute**: The project is focused on teaching researchers and students the best practices for effectively running machine learning (ML) and data science applications on advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) and high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Applications due 12 April 2024. https://www.sdsc.edu/education_and_training/ciml_summer_institute.html 

* **SDSC HPC and Data Science Summer Institute**: The program is aimed at researchers in academia and industry, especially in domains not traditionally engaged in supercomputing, who have problems that cannot typically be solved using local computing resources. Applications due 26 April 2024. https://www.sdsc.edu/education_and_training/summer_institute.html

Keep an eye on our blog for more opportunities and HYAK updates. 

If you have any questions, please reach out to the team by emailing help@uw.edu and we sure to mention Hyak in the subject line. Thanks!
