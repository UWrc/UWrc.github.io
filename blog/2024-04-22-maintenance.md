Hello HYAK Community,

Thank you for your patience this month while we had more scheduled downtime than usual to allow for electrical reconfiguration work in the UW data center. We appreciate how disruptive this work has been in recent weeks, we wanted to assure the community that the benefit is to create additional power capacity that will allow HYAK to grow and broaden its support of the UW research community.

In addition to our regular maintenance, we wanted to make you aware for the following changes initiated during scheduled downtime:
- We implemented an increase in checkpoint (`--partition=ckpt`) runtime for **GPU jobs** from 4-5 hours to 8-9 hours (pre-emption requeuing will still occur without notice). Please see our updated [**documentation page**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/compute/checkpoint) for more details about using idle resources. 

Our next scheduled maintenance will be Tuesday May, 14, 2024. 

#### Training Opportunities
Follow NSF ACCESS Training and Events posting [**HERE**](https://support.access-ci.org/news/events-trainings) to find online webinars about containers, parallel computing, using GPUs, and more from HPC providers around the USA. 

Questions?
If you have any questions for us, please reach out to the team by emailing help@uw.edu with Hyak in the subject line.
