Hello HYAK Community,

Thanks again for your patience with our monthly scheduled maintenance. During this maintenance session, we were able to provide package updates to node images to ensure compliance with the latest operating system level security fixes and performance optimizations.

The next maintenance will be **Tuesday September 10, 2024**. 

### New self-hosted S3 storage option: KOPAH 

We are happy to announce the preview launch of our self-hosted S3 storage called KOPAH. **S3 storage** is a solution for securely storing and managing large amounts of data, whether for personal use or research computing. It works like an online storage locker where you store can files of any size, accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. For researchers and those involved in data-driven studies, it provides a reliable and scalable platform to store, access, and analyze large datasets, supporting high-performance computing tasks and complex workflows. 

S3 uses **buckets** as containers to store data, where each bucket can hold 100,000,000 **objects**, which are the actual files or data you store. Each object within a bucket is identified by a unique key, making it easy to organize and retrieve your data efficiently. Public links can be generated for KOPAH objects so that users can share buckets and objects with collaborators.

#### Who should use KOPAH?

KOPAH is a storage solution for anyone. Just like other storage options out there, you can upload, download, and view your storage bucket with specialized tools and share your data via the internet. For Hyak users, KOPAH provides another storage option for research computing. It is more affordable than /gscratch storage and can be used for active research computing with a few added steps for retreiving stored data prior to a job. 

#### Test Users Wanted

Prior to September, we are inviting test users to try KOPAH and provide feedback about their experience. If you are interested in becoming a KOPAH test user, please each help@uw.edu with Hyak or KOPAH in the subject line. 

Requirements: 
1. While we will not charge for the service until September 1, to sign up as a test user, we require a budget number and worktag. If the service doesn't work for you, you can cancel before September. 
2. We will ask for a name for the account. If your groups has an existing account on Hyak, klone /gscratch, it makes sense of the names to match across services. 
3. Please be ready to respond with your feedback about the service. 

### Opportunities

PhD students should check out this opportunity for funding from NVIDIA: [**Graduate Research Fellowship Program**](https://research.nvidia.com/graduate-fellowships?ncid=em-anno-418307&mkt_tok=MTU2LU9GTi03NDIAAAGU66sxhZb7nVknt2ICFMyZpmhp3x-btkJltaLrwMw8SmjKcfYYXy3SoWfDaQgRnSLcpzCf-X_Enesg5ERgNElSwKPLtuRUx5Q-D236iO2nNV_hCkoNsLQ)


Questions? If you have any questions for us, please reach out to the team by emailing help@uw.edu with Hyak in the subject line.
