## Subscribe to the mailing list

Our primary method of communicating with the Hyak community is via the Hyak Users mailing list. You can subscribe to the mailing list [here](https://mailman1.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/hyak-users).

We respect your inboxes, so every email we send is brief & operational. We send two emails every month:

1. A one-week reminder about our monthly maintenance period (which occurs on the second Tuesday of every month).
2. An all-clear when the monthly maintenance is finished and the clusters have resumed normal operations. This all-clear also serves as our "newsletter," so to speak, where we explain any changes made to the cluster and give updates on major projects.

Outside of these two recurring messages, we only send urgent operational updates: systemic cluster issues & ETAs for resolving those issues.
