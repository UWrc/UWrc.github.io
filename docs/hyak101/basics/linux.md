 For example, if you wanted to execute a command on a dataset, you would have to execute that command from the directory where the dataset is located on `klone`, which for this tutorial may be in `/sw/hyak101/basics/`. To successfully execute the command you will either have to be inside of the directory where the data is (with `cd`) or reference the dataset using its enitre absolute path, for example, with `/sw/hyak101/basics/dataset.csv`.
