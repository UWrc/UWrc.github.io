### Goals & Rationale

#### Our first goal is to provide a tutorial that give brand new HYAK users some fundamental skills they will need to navigate the HYAK file system and Linux command-line interface (CLI). 

Much of the HYAK documentation is organized into bite sized instructional guide for a particular software tool or concept, but these may be too advanced for users who are brand new to High Performance Computing (HPC) and Linux CLI. Here we have prepared a walk-through tutorial of programs (which we will refer to as **commands**) that you may find helpful before moving forward with your resaerch computing project. 

#### Our second goal is to dimystify job submission and help researcher efficiently use HYAK's computing resources for their research. 

While we have some [**documentation discussing Scheduling Jobs with SLURM**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/compute/scheduling-jobs), we wanted to go into greater depth and provide some template scripts that you might be able to tailor to your research project. 

#### Our ultimate goal is to prepare you as an independent user of HYAK. 

Ultimately, we want you to feel comfortable working independently on HYAK and tailoring tools and scripts to the needs of your research project.

### Course Description

We are going to execute several commands on HYAK, a Linux CLI. After that we are going to go more deeply into scheduling jobs with SLURM. 

This tutorial offers a worked example with publicly available data for submitting an array job with SLURM (i.e., submitting multiple jobs to be performed in parallel).

:::warning
We will focus on `klone` for this tutorial as `mox` is in its decommissioning era. However, the Linux CLI tools will be useful across many systems including `mox`. Unfortunately, there may be portions of this tutorial that are not supported on `mox` or a different cluster.

### Extra Practice

We have curated a list of [**Additional Resources**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/resources) and you will find many are relevant for this tutorial. 

:::info Acknowledgements
Some sections were modeled after or borrowed from [**The Unix Shell by Software Carpentry**](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/index.html), but have been tailored to fit most HYAK users.
