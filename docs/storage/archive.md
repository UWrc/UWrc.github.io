The storage attached to HYAK clusters is considered a transient place for "hot" data. This is stuff you're actively computing against. It's slow, cheap, and has physical longevity as a storage medium. These are desired properties for an archive tier.

## Google Drive

The UW has a relationship with Google for cloud services (e.g., Gmail, Google Drive). Google Drive has a reputation for "unlimited" data storage. It's possible you can use this as one place to store your data but we leave it to the user to perform their own due diligence on the implications of this. Some labs at the UW make use of Google Drive in this manner so we thought we'd make note of it here but we provide no support for it.
