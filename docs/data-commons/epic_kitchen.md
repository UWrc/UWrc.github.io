Sponsoring groups are Rajesh Rao, Abhishek Gupta, Ali Farhadi. Student users are Vishwas Sathish, Chuning Zhu, and Aditya Kusupati. Initial deployment of **April 2024**.

## What is this?
Epic kitchens is a large-scale dataset in first-person (egocentric) vision; multi-faceted, audio-visual, non-scripted recordings in native environments - i.e. the wearers' homes, capturing all daily activities in the kitchen over multiple days. Annotations are collected using a 'Pause-and-Talk' narration interface.
You can learn more at their website [here](https://epic-kitchens.github.io/2024) or from their paper [here](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Dima_Damen_Scaling_Egocentric_Vision_ECCV_2018_paper.html).

## How to prepare for use?

Install [decord](https://github.com/dmlc/decord) on your python environment to read the video files. You can also use other libraries to read video frames. Popular ones include [OpenCV](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41441150/how-to-read-video-files-using-python-opencv), and [skvideo](https://www.scikit-video.org/stable/).

```python
from decord import VideoReader, cpu

# load a single file of the dataset
video_clip_path = "/<path>/<to>/<video_folder>/LABLE/IDX-start_time-end_time.mp4"
vr = VideoReader(file_path, num_threads=-1, ctx=cpu(0))

```
