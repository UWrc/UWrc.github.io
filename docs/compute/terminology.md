## The Slurm Scheduler

## Accounts, Partitions, and QOS

accounts = lab = group

partition = collection of a resource type (have access to amount contributed, on-demand)

qos = how the "amount contributed" actually works, not relevant to submission

We have modified Slurm (via job submit lua) that derives QOS automatically, usually.
